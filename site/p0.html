Born to die was realeased in 2012 and is a pop album. It was her first professionaly produced album and made her famous. She stood out by having a low voice and people loved it. Her biggest hit in the ablum was Summertime Sadness which has over a billion streams.

    My favorite song in this album is Off to the Races. In this song, there is a bad rich man that she's in love with and he accepts her craziness and her love of money. Her love for money is shown in the lyrics "Gimme them gold coins". Another interisting song is "Lolita", which is a refrence to Vladimir Nabokov's book, Lolita, which is about a hebephilic man.
