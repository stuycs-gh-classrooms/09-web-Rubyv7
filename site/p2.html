Honeymoon
</h2>
<p>
Honeymoon is mostly about love. My favorie song in the album is the Blackest day. In this song the stages of breakups are expressed such as sadness, anger, and acceptance. In the chorus she refers to her ex-lover as her baby and says that since he's left shes been miserable. Also, in the bridge she mentions a "she" which is another man that Lana was likely jealous of.
