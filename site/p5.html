In COTCC's album cover, it shows a picture of Lana and her friends together. This is her 7th album and is more about reminiscing about the past with some themes of love. A previous producer, Jack Antloff, was also the producer of this album. It's also described as a country genre, making it unique to most of her other albums.

  My favorite song in this album is "Dark But Just a Game" and it was inspired by Jack Antloff's quote at a party. This song is mostly about the relationship with fame and it's consequences. In the beginning of the song, it talks about the sad end that most celebrities face as trhe perice of their fame. She later says that she doesn't want the same to happen and will remain true to her personality. Furthemore, she talks about the hate she recieves as a famous person.
