  My favorite artist is Lana del Rey. The song that got me into her was "Off to the Races" and is in the Born to Die album. This site includes some of her albums and my favorite song from them, the songs in the album and some other fun facts. Her albums have an occurring theme of love yet a different vibe to them.

She has an unreleased song called Lake Placid and quite a few songs are about New York. She attented Fordham University in the Bronx and also has an unreleased song called Fordham Road. Her first huge song was "Videogames" in 2011. Furthermore, she has a poetry book called <i> Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass</i>, which I really loved.
