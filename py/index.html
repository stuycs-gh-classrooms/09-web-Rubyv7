      A lone fighter passes through a creepy forest hiding treasures and monsters, his goal is to make it out safe. It starts with the viewer picking out a name and agreeing to go on an adventure. The viewer rolls a number to move him, it may land on a monster, treasure, help, or nothing. What the fighter lands on depends on the roll. If the fighter meets a monster, he has the option to choose how to fight it, if he chooses wrong he dies and a "You Died" screen will pop up with the option to restart. The possible monsters he can encounter are ghosts, goblins, or witches. They will have options that are specific to their character. The game ends after he rolls 5 times and stays alive.
