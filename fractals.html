<h2>
Kochcurve

<h2>
Sierpinski Triangle
</h2>

<body>
  The edited Sierpinski triangle has the top and bottom left triangles missing their bottom side, making a rhombus and another weird quadrilateral in the center. It's also purple. 
</body>
<h2>
  Trees
</h2>

<body>
  This tree is brown, has red apples and orange leaves on it. It randomly places an apple, which is a red circle, on the branches. (tree2(t, 4, 50, 20))
