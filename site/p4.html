NFR was released in 2019 and has 14 songs. It was named after the artist Norman Rockwell. This album seems to not have a specific theme and one song she misses a guy and then another talks about the bad things in a relationship. It has Lana's longest song, Venice B**** which is over 9 minutes long.

    My favorite song in the album is California. This song talks about her regret for a past lover and that she wants to get back with them. My favorite lines are the first 2 lines,  “You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are/ When you're lying in my arms, baby”. I really love that she shows she’ll love him even if he's not the best and he can be who he is with her. All she wants is him next to her. Furthermore a fun facts is that the guy in the album cover is, Duke Nicholson, Jack Nicholson’s grandson.
